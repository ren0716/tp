4. Run the application by following these steps:<br>
   1. Open a command window:
      - **Windows**: Press **Windows** + **R**, type `cmd`, and press **Enter**.
      - **Mac/Linux**: Open the Terminal app.
   2. Go to the folder where you saved the tutortrack.jar file:
      - Type `cd`(with a space after it), then drag and drop the folder into the window.
      - Press **Enter**. 
   3. Run the app:
      - Type this command and press **Enter**: <br>
        `java -jar tutortrack.jar`
   4. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/UiUpdated.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press **Enter** to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing **Enter** will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all students.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 l/2 c/Physics-1800` : Adds a student contact named `John Doe` to TutorTrack.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all students.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [c/CLASS] [a/ASSIGNMENT]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/Physics-1800 a/Assignment 1` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[c/CLASS]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `c/Physics-1800`, `c/Math-1400 c/Physics-1800` etc.

* Parameters (excluding INDEX) can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Prefixes and parameters are case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME` and `N/NAME` are treated the same, likewise with `n/John Doe` and `n/john doe`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `clear`, `undo` and `redo`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about parameter validation rules:**<br>

* `NAME` parameter values allows only alphanumeric values, spaces, hyphens, periods, apostrophes and slashes. <br> **(Letters that come after apostrophes, dashes, slashes, periods are automatically capitalised)** <br>
  e.g. `n/John Doe`, `n/Betsy O'Connor`, `n/Mary-Jane Smith Jr.` are all acceptable but `n/John@Doe`, `n/John#1` is not.

* `CLASS` and `ASSIGNMENT` parameter values allows only alphanumeric values, spaces and hyphens.<br>
  e.g. `c/Math-1000`, `c/Computer Science 101`, `a/Project Draft 1` are all acceptable but `c/Math@1000`, `c/Math(1000)` is not.

* **[WARNING]** Whitespace inside `NAME`, `CLASS` and `ASSIGNMENT` parameter values is preserved and treated as significant.<br>
  e.g. `c/Math2000` will be different from `c/Math 2000`.

* `PHONE` parameter values must be numeric and be at least 3 digits long.<br>
  e.g. `p/98765432` is acceptable but `p/98A7654` or `p/12` is not.

* `LEVEL` parameter values must be an integer between 1 and 5 (inclusive).<br>
    e.g. `l/2` is acceptable but `l/0`, `l/6`, `l/2.5`, `l/two` are not.
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Duplicate Checks:**<br>

* Students:
  * Students are considered duplicates if they have the same name (case-insensitive) AND phone number.
  * Students with same name but different phone numbers can be added with a _warning_.
  * Students with same phone number but different names can be added with a _warning_.
* Assignments:
  * Assignments are considered duplicates if the student already has an assignment with the assignment name (case-insensitive) from the same class.
* Classes:
  * Classes are considered duplicates if the student is already enrolled in a class with the same class name (case-insensitive).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"><span class="fas fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>Tip:</strong>

Like [`mark`]( #marking-an-assignment-as-completed-mark ), use [`filter`](#filtering-students-by-class-filter) first for efficient unmarking by class.
</div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `unmark 1 3-5 c/Math-2000 a/MathHW1` unmarks the assignment `MathHW1` from class `Math-2000` as not completed for the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th students in the student list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning"><span class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>Caution:</strong>

Deleting a class deletes all assignments associated with it for that student as well.
</div>

<a id="clearing-all-entries-clear"></a>
### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from TutorTrack.

Format: `clear`

<a id="undoing-previous-command-undo"></a>
### Undoing previous command : `undo`

Undoes the previous command that modified the data.

Format: `undo`

* Restores TutorTrack to the state before the last command that changed the data.
* Only commands that modify data (e.g., `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `assign`, `mark`) can be undone.
* Commands that do not modify data (e.g., `list`, `find`, `help`) cannot be undone.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"><span class="fas fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>Tip:</strong>

If you accidentally deleted a student or made an unwanted change, use `undo` to quickly restore the previous state.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning"><span class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>Caution:</strong>

Undo/Redo only works for actions made in the **current session**. Once you leave or refresh, previous changes cannot be restored.
</div>

Examples:
* `delete 1` followed by `undo` adds the deleted student back.

<a id="redoing-previously-undone-command-redo"></a>
### Redoing previously undone command : `redo`

Redoes a command that was previously undone.

Format: `redo`

* Redo only works if no new commands have been issued after the undo.
* After using `undo` multiple times, you can use `redo` multiple times to reapply those changes.

Examples:
* `delete 1` followed by `undo` followed by `redo` deletes the student again.

<a id="exiting-the-program-exit"></a>
### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

TutorTrack data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TutorTrack data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/tutortrack.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning"><span class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>Caution:</strong>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TutorTrack will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause TutorTrack to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TutorTrack home folder.

**Q**: Can I use TutorTrack on multiple computers?<br>
**A**: Yes, but TutorTrack does not support real-time synchronization. You will need to manually transfer the `tutortrack.json` data file between computers to keep data consistent.

**Q**: What if the data file becomes corrupted?<br>
**A**: Restore from your backup. If no backup exists, the app will create a fresh `tutortrack.json` and you may lose previous data.

**Q**: How do I back up my data?<br>
**A**: Regularly copy `data/tutortrack.json` (and optionally `preferences.json`) to a secure location, such as an external hard drive or cloud storage service.

**Q**: Can I edit `data/tutortrack.json` manually?<br>
**A**: Yes, but only if you know the expected JSON structure. Always make a backup first; invalid edits may cause the app to discard data on next run.

**Q**: Will data work across app versions?<br>
**A**: Minor patch updates are generally compatible. For major version changes, check release notes for migration instructions before copying files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.<br>

<box type="info" seamless>

**How to find `preferences.json`:**<br>
   
**Windows**:<br>
1. Go to the same folder where you keep your `tutortrack.jar` file. <br>
2. Look for a file named `preferences.json` in that folder (it might be inside a subfolder named something like `data` or `.tutortrack`). <br>
3. Delete `preferences.json`. <br>
4. Run the app again using: `java -jar tutortrack.jar`<br>
5. The GUI should now open on your primary screen.<br>

**Mac/Linux**:<br>
1. Open **Finder** (Mac) or **Files** app (Linux).<br>
2. Go to the folder where your `tutortrack.jar` file is saved. <br>
3. Find and delete the `preferences.json` file (it might be in a hidden folder called `.tutortrack` — press **Command** + **Shift** + **.** on Mac to show hidden files). <br>
4. Start the app again — it will open correctly.<br>
</box>


2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
